# coding_fellowship_2018
# This repository is dedicated to half started projects assigned with the intention of acquiring knowledge regarding web development
# and gaining proficiency in HTML, JavaScript, PHP, CSS, and some SQL. 
#
# In no way should these projects be viewed as completed, they are testing grounds for various exercises and half baked inspirations 
# that were left behind in the name of progress and learning.
