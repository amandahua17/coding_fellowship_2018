				<h1>What is Flavor Text?</h1>
				<p>In a game, sometimes items, actions, or mechanics etc. will have flavor text, which are just extra snippets of text that
				<br>aren't related to actual gameplay rules or affect anything-- they're just there for effect. It's pretty much just fluff,
				<br>but it can add realism, enhance the tone, include extra background information or narrative, or be funny. (Urban Dictionary)
				<br>In the context of this site, flavor text is essentially the same as as in a game, it's a small snippet that will pop up if
				<br>the picture doesn't load.</p>";
